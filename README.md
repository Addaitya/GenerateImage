# Generate Images

This project implements **lazy loading** with **skeleton screens** to enhance the user experience while dog images are being loaded. The application fetches random dog images from the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/) and displays them with a smooth loading effect.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they are about to enter the viewport, improving performance and reducing initial load time.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Grey placeholder boxes are shown while the images are loading, providing a better visual experience for users.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- External API: [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/)
